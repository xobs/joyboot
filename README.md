Joyboot
=======

This is a bootloader for the Palawan joystick project.  It can update Palawan boards
over USB or wireless.


Hardware
--------

Joyboot runs on Palawan hardware, both on the Tx board and on the Rx USB board.  As
such, it includes a bit-banged USB stack.

The source for the hardware may be downloaded at https://github.com/xobs/palawan-hw


Software
--------

The software is still in flux.  It will have an accompanying PC program to control the
hardware, however this program is still being written.
